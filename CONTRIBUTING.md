## Setup your machine

`alist` is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Prerequisites:

- [git](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/)
- [Go 1.18+](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)

Clone `alist` and `alist-web` anywhere:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Xhofe/alist.git
$ git clone https://github.com/Xhofe/alist-web.git
```
You should switch to the dev branch for development.

## Preview your change
### backend
```shell
$ go run alist.go
```
### frontend
```shell
$ yarn dev
```

## Create a commit

Commit messages should be well formatted, and to make that "standardized".

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header
of the reverted commit.
In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit
being reverted.

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
* **build**: Affects project builds or dependency modifications
* **revert**: Restore the previous commit
* **ci**: Continuous integration of related file modifications
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation
* **release**: Release a new version
* **workflow**: Workflow related file modification

### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `$location`,
`$browser`, `$compile`, `$rootScope`, `ngHref`, `ngClick`, `ngView`, etc...

You can use `*` when the change affects more than a single scope.

### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
[reference GitHub issues that this commit closes](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.
The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

Push your branch to your `alist` fork and open a pull request against the
`dev` branch.
